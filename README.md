## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to explore beta relative to the S&P 500. Specifically, the analysis will be used to aid in the formation of a beta-weighted delta-neutral stock options portfolio. This is merely the start of the project, and as time progresses I will continue to add new findings to the repository.

## Steps Involved:
1. Extract data from Bloomberg Terminal using the API to Excel.
2. Load the Excel file into Python for analysis.
3. Manipulate and explore the data using Pandas.

## Current Findings:
- Sector betas tend to be mean-reverting.
- Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors exhibit high positive betas, making them less useful in a beta-weighted delta-neutral stock options portfolio.
- Utilities and Consumer Staples sectors have low positive betas, making them suitable candidates for shorting in a beta-weighted delta-neutral stock options portfolio.
