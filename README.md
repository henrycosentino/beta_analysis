## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to explore beta relative to the S&P 500. Specifically, the analysis will be used to aid in the formation of beta-weighted delta-neutral stock option portfolios. This is merely the start of the project, and as time progresses I will continue to add new findings to the repository.

## Steps Involved:
1. Extract data from the Bloomberg Terminal using the API and import it into Excel.
2. Load the Excel file into Python for analysis.
3. Manipulate and explore the data using Pandas.

## Current Findings:
- Sector betas tend to be mean-reverting.
- Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors exhibit high positive betas, making them less useful in a delta-neutral portfolio.
- Utilities and Consumer Staples sectors have low positive betas, making them suitable candidates for shorting in a delta-neutral portfolio.
